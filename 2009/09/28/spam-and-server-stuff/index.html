        <p>So, I&rsquo;ve only been up for about three weeks and I&rsquo;ve already got my first spam comment (which is why I moderate all comments ATM.) Also, it was kind of strange, I went to go here at work today and I wasn&rsquo;t able to connect. So, I logged into my router. I thought that my iptables were screwy again, so I started trying to fix them by hand. Deleted a rule and BAM no more connectivity to my router (at all.) So I had to wait to get home to login locally, flush iptables, and reload my firewall. Then I decided to login to my server. Wouldn&rsquo;t you know it, Apache was no longer running. Check the logs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Sun Sep 27 06:25:07 2009] [notice] Graceful restart requested, doing restart
apache2: Could not open configuration file /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: No such file or directory</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well of course you can&rsquo;t, you were probably incorrectly told to reload rather than do a proper restart. So the etc/apache2/apache2.conf isn&rsquo;t in the chroot. So, I changed the init.d/apache2 to have reload and force-reload do restart instead. Hopefully that&rsquo;ll fix that so I won&rsquo;t have to worry about my server magically failing on me again.</p>
