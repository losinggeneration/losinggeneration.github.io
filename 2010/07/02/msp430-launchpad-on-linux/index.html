        <p>I got an MSP430 Launchpad in the mail a couple of days ago. So I&rsquo;ve been playing with that the last couple of days. The first day I went through the tools on the wiki and grabbed both IDE&rsquo;s and all the downloadable links I could. This had to be done on Windows since it&rsquo;s the only platform they support. Being a Linux user 99% of the time, I wasn&rsquo;t too pleased with this situation, so I investigated the tools available for Linux, and that&rsquo;s what I did all of yesterday.</p>
<p>First, I searched the Arch Linux repos (including AUR) for MSP430 related tools. I used yaourt and searched for both msp &amp; msp430. I compiled and installed the compiler, the C library, and two debuggers (more on this later.) After these were installed I grabbed the source to the temperature demo that comes preloaded on the chip. First thing I had to do was change the source in order for it to build with msp430-gcc. The changes were trivial and it didn&rsquo;t take too long to get it compiled. What took me the longest time was trying to figure out if I needed to define what mcu I&rsquo;m using. After a bit of research I fired up the debugger, erased the flash, reflashed, and did some light debugging.</p>
<p>Now, for how it&rsquo;s done. The packages you&rsquo;ll need are as follows: Updated 2012-06-13<code>binutils-msp430 2.21.1-2&lt;br /&gt; gcc-msp430 4.6.3-1&lt;br /&gt; msp430-gdb 7.2-3&lt;br /&gt; msp430-libc 20120224-2&lt;br /&gt; msp430mcu 20120406-2&lt;br /&gt; mspdebug 0.8-1</code>If you&rsquo;re using a distro other than Arch, it&rsquo;s up to you to figure out how to get and/or build the programs from the source. If you&rsquo;re using Arch, you can obviously use the AUR packages with ABS. If you&rsquo;re an i686 user you can grab my prebuild binaries if you&rsquo;d like from <a href="/wp-upload/msp430/">here</a>. Now that you have a toolchain, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll want to test it out. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Grab my &ldquo;ported&rdquo; <a href="/wp-upload/msp430/temperature-demo.tar.bz2">temperature demo</a>.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>UPDATE</strong> The here&rsquo;s the fully working <a href="/wp-upload/msp430/temperature-demo.tgz">temperature demo.</a> You&rsquo;ll need to extract it, fire up a terminal, go to that directory, and you should be able to just type: make. If all goes as planned, you&rsquo;ll have main.elf in that directory. So now it&rsquo;s time to try it out, fire up mspdebug. The actual command is probably going to be something like: sudo mspdebug -R. Permissions on the USB device might be able to be changed so it doesn&rsquo;t have to be run as root, but for me and for now, it&rsquo;s not too big of a deal. You should get something like this: `sudo mspdebug -R<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<p>There you have it, you should be in pretty good shape to start experimenting with the MSP430 Launchpad on Linux.</p>
<p>Addendum:
Big thanks to Henry von Tresckow (hvontres) who fixed the temperature demo to fully work with mspgcc. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m yet to test it, but his changes look convincing enough.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I&rsquo;ve tested the changes and they seem to work fine. Here&rsquo;s the <a href="/wp-upload/msp430/temperature-demo.tgz">updated temperature demo</a> (updated 2012-06-13.)</p>
<p>Update:
Added msp430mcu as a required package. Thanks Frankie Robertson for pointing that out in the comments. üôÇ</p>
