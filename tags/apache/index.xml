      <title>Pleased with Server’s Performance</title>

      <description>I have to say, my server is performing beyond my initial expectations! I think I have everything tweaked to not use massive amounts of RAM (*cough*MySQL*cough*.) Here&amp;rsquo;s how the free -m currently looks:
$ free -m total used free shared buffers cached Mem: 121 90 31 0 2 46 -/+ buffers/cache: 41 80 Swap: 1121 14 1107 As you can see, it&amp;rsquo;s doing pretty good. I&amp;rsquo;ve even upped the maximum simultaneous Apache connections since it seems to be able to handle that a better now (rather then bringing the server to its knees when something like 10-15 people tried to access it at once.</description>

      <title>Server hammered</title>

      <description>So, I recently set a link to my discussion of Linux, GNU, and OS&amp;rsquo;s to someone on Identi.ca. I made a point not to add groups to !linux and !gnu because I knew my server would probably get hit hard (if you&amp;rsquo;ve looked at my server&amp;rsquo;s specs, you&amp;rsquo;ll know it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take much to be considered hit hard.) Well, they read it, after which they posted a link to my blog with the groups !</description>

      <title>Spam and Server stuff</title>

      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;ve only been up for about three weeks and I&amp;rsquo;ve already got my first spam comment (which is why I moderate all comments ATM.) Also, it was kind of strange, I went to go here at work today and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to connect. So, I logged into my router. I thought that my iptables were screwy again, so I started trying to fix them by hand. Deleted a rule and BAM no more connectivity to my router (at all.</description>

      <title>Few more things that I should fix yet</title>

      <description>Well now that the system is live, I think there&amp;rsquo;s going to be a few things I&amp;rsquo;m going to need to fix. Most all of them are from using mod_chroot. Most aren&amp;rsquo;t anything critical, but things that should be addressed (sooner rather than later.) For instance, I think DNS lookups are failing from inside WordPress. I breifly read in the mod_chroot caveates that this may happen, and I think this is happening now.</description>

      <title>Pretty much ready</title>

      <description>Well, my server is pretty much ready I now. Apache is chrooted and seems to be working well. I also did a self-signed cert in hopes that&amp;rsquo;ll make my remote logins even more secure to WordPress. SSH access is limited to keyed logins. Ntpd is running in hopes of keeping the system&amp;rsquo;s clock sane. I&amp;rsquo;ve moved all my Git repos here and even have my CGit vhost running/working. Git daemon is also running.</description>

      <title>Chrooted Apache</title>
      <link>https://losinggeneration.com/2009/09/13/chrooted-apache/</link>

      <description>﻿
As I prepare to have my server public, I&amp;rsquo;ve chrooted my server&amp;rsquo;s Apache with mod_chroot. This allows me to have the advantages of a chroot environment without as many of the draw backs. There is still some strangeness to work out. For instance &amp;ldquo;Warning: timezone_open() [function.timezone-open]: Unknown or bad timezone (America/Chicago) in /wp/wp-includes/functions.phpon line 3160&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;ll get this figured out, but honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s not a huge deal. I may have to have Apache load the zoneinfo file, or perhaps not… Really, the only change I had to make to WordPress was to have it connect to the MySQL database on 127.</description>

      <title>First post on my new server</title>

      <description>Well, I have my new server up and running (though it&amp;rsquo;ll probably be awhile before anyone will be able to see this since I&amp;rsquo;m not done securing it making it a dmz so people can access it.) I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why I decided to setup a blog, but I did, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to see how it goes.</description>
