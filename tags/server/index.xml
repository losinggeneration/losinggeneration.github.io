      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve now updated my home server to Debian 6.0. In the process I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to also switch to lighttpd from Apache HTTP. I do miss the fact that mod_chroot in Apache was able to basically take care of the dependencies for me and build the chroot daemon startup, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much work to get everything up and going in a chroot. It ended up one of my plugins (Last.</description>

      <title>New Temporary Server</title>
      <link>https://losinggeneration.com/2010/07/09/new-temporary-server/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to be without internet at home for awhile it looks like. The server this blog was run from was just a computer I had in my apartment. Since that&amp;rsquo;s going to be down sometime in the near future I decided it was time to figure out something to do in the meantime. The solution was to move this blog to a server I know will stay up while I&amp;rsquo;m moving.</description>

      <title>Backups</title>
      <link>https://losinggeneration.com/2009/12/22/backups/</link>

      <description>I decided it was time to have some form of backups in place. Currently all I&amp;rsquo;m really (automatically) backing up is the WordPress MySQL table since it&amp;rsquo;s the thing to changes on a regular basis. Everything else on this server can be backed up by hand when/if I make changes. It would be faster if/when something does fail (hard drive most likely) to have a recent full backup image to restore from, but really, a good backup of the MySQL table(s), a backup of important configuration files (since they rarely change, I back them up manually after change(s)), and a backup up various directories that&amp;rsquo;d be nice to restore quickly (most of which change infrequently.</description>

      <title>Pleased with Server’s Performance</title>

      <description>I have to say, my server is performing beyond my initial expectations! I think I have everything tweaked to not use massive amounts of RAM (*cough*MySQL*cough*.) Here&amp;rsquo;s how the free -m currently looks: $ free -m&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; total used free shared buffers cached&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; Mem: 121 90 31 0 2 46&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; -/+ buffers/cache: 41 80&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; Swap: 1121 14 1107 As you can see, it&amp;rsquo;s doing pretty good. I&amp;rsquo;ve even upped the maximum simultaneous Apache connections since it seems to be able to handle that a better now (rather then bringing the server to its knees when something like 10-15 people tried to access it at once.</description>

      <title>Taken care of</title>

      <description>Well, I think I have all the previous issues taken care of. Caching may or may not work, but it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be happening now. So mail and DNS lookups work now (DNS only being useful from my side.) So, all-in-all I hope this beast can just run for several months and I&amp;rsquo;ll see what (if anything) needs to be done in that time. So now that my server should be stable, I&amp;rsquo;m free to work on other endevors!</description>

      <title>Pretty much ready</title>
      <link>https://losinggeneration.com/2009/09/13/pretty-much-ready/</link>

      <description>Well, my server is pretty much ready I now. Apache is chrooted and seems to be working well. I also did a self-signed cert in hopes that&amp;rsquo;ll make my remote logins even more secure to WordPress. SSH access is limited to keyed logins. Ntpd is running in hopes of keeping the system&amp;rsquo;s clock sane. I&amp;rsquo;ve moved all my Git repos here and even have my CGit vhost running/working. Git daemon is also running.</description>

      <title>Chrooted Apache</title>
      <link>https://losinggeneration.com/2009/09/13/chrooted-apache/</link>

      <description>﻿
As I prepare to have my server public, I&amp;rsquo;ve chrooted my server&amp;rsquo;s Apache with mod_chroot. This allows me to have the advantages of a chroot environment without as many of the draw backs. There is still some strangeness to work out. For instance &amp;ldquo;Warning: timezone_open() [function.timezone-open]: Unknown or bad timezone (America/Chicago) in /wp/wp-includes/functions.phpon line 3160&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;ll get this figured out, but honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s not a huge deal. I may have to have Apache load the zoneinfo file, or perhaps not… Really, the only change I had to make to WordPress was to have it connect to the MySQL database on 127.</description>

      <title>First post on my new server</title>

      <description>Well, I have my new server up and running (though it&amp;rsquo;ll probably be awhile before anyone will be able to see this since I&amp;rsquo;m not done securing it making it a dmz so people can access it.) I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why I decided to setup a blog, but I did, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to see how it goes.</description>
