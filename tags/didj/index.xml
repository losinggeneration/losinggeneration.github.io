      <description>Well, I&amp;rsquo;m releasing what I&amp;rsquo;ll call version 0.1.0 of CrabEmu for the Didj. It includes a custom built rootfs with no questionable code from the LF distribution (for instance, their scripts for checking various things like USB connections.) This initial release requires a DJHI or other third party card that is SD capable. The SD must also have two partitions: Fat32 &amp;amp; Ext 3. Because of the later, you&amp;rsquo;ll also need an OS that&amp;rsquo;s able to read/write to Ext 3 file systems.</description>

      <title>Didj OpenGL ES</title>

      <description>Well, I may be the first to get even basic OpenGL ES primitives to render. I can now make my claim that NeHe lesson02 works for the Didj. Some others have things such as OpenGL version strings, but I believe this is the first actual rendering for Didj homebrew. I&amp;rsquo;ve gone a slightly different route then what others have done. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Brio directly to satisfy some of the OpenGL ES dependencies.</description>

      <description>Well, I now have my Didj, a Serial-&amp;gt;USB breakoutboard, and a DJHI v2.0 prototype board. With these I&amp;rsquo;m able to get serial access to the Didj. I&amp;rsquo;ve flashed a new version of the Lightning Boot bootloader which jburks has been hard at work on. It adds a boot menu which is very useful for booting new kernels off of an SD card. jburks also has a preliminary kernel driver to access the SD card from within Linux.</description>

      <description>On Woot yesterday they had these Didj systems. I&amp;rsquo;ve read about it on Hack a Day several times, and I decided to get one and (hopefully) join in with some of the fun. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any real concrete plans for this cool little Linux device. I just want to see what cool things can be done with it (first hand.)</description>
