  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>This blog has seen a lot of changes over the last decade, from being hosted in my
apartment on a machine with 128MB of RAM with dynamic DNS, to being hosted at
on company servers (with permission of course), to being hosted by Digital
Ocean in a couple Docker containers, to now, finally being hosted on Github
Pages. This most recent move is the most significant because it&rsquo;s the switch
from a dynamic content generator (Wordpress) to a static content generator
(Hugo.) I&rsquo;ve been wanting to make this conversion for at least there years now,
but it&rsquo;s never been a priority. However, that&rsquo;s changed for a couple of
reasons. I clearly haven&rsquo;t been doing much to update the content here, and as
a quick way to get SSL on the site I used a load balancer on Digital Ocean to
have it use Let&rsquo;s Encrypt. However, the load balancer was two thirds of my bill
each month for DO. That, mixed with the fact that in order to update Wordpress
I&rsquo;ll have spin up a new container with PHP updated, meant it was time to bite
the bullet &amp; spend a few hours converting &amp; reviewing the converted content.</p>
<p>When all was said &amp; done, the process to switch it over wasn&rsquo;t too bad. The
thing that took the longest was because plugins &amp; other things affected the
content in Wordpress already causing them to not render correctly there, so
they obviously didn&rsquo;t work in Hugo either. All in all, though, the process
wasn&rsquo;t too bad.</p>
<p>This has motivated me a bit more to make more updates here. The work flow is
much more in line with what I want to use, Wordress has done very well over,
but it&rsquo;s time for me to move on.</p>
