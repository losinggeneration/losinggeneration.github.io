      <description>After my server was down for a couple days (because I was physically moving the machine to another location) I decided to check if there were any updates. Sure enough, there just happened to be an update for 3.2 and it had the usual warning of &amp;ldquo;be sure to backup your database and files&amp;rdquo; which I either ignore or partially ignore. I do typically do a mysqldump before running any of the updates, but I almost never backup the WordPress directory itself.</description>

      <description>I just thought I&amp;rsquo;d make a quick post about two WordPress plugins which seem to work great for spam detection. The first one is Akismet. Alone it seems to catch most spam here. The problem with this plugin alone is, there may still be false positives. This requires more time on my part to skim over my spam to see if there was any legit comments.
This brings me to the second plugin, Conditional CAPTCHA.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve now updated my home server to Debian 6.0. In the process I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to also switch to lighttpd from Apache HTTP. I do miss the fact that mod_chroot in Apache was able to basically take care of the dependencies for me and build the chroot daemon startup, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much work to get everything up and going in a chroot. It ended up one of my plugins (Last.</description>

      <description>I have to say, my server is performing beyond my initial expectations! I think I have everything tweaked to not use massive amounts of RAM (*cough*MySQL*cough*.) Here&amp;rsquo;s how the free -m currently looks:
$ free -m total used free shared buffers cached Mem: 121 90 31 0 2 46 -/+ buffers/cache: 41 80 Swap: 1121 14 1107 As you can see, it&amp;rsquo;s doing pretty good. I&amp;rsquo;ve even upped the maximum simultaneous Apache connections since it seems to be able to handle that a better now (rather then bringing the server to its knees when something like 10-15 people tried to access it at once.</description>

      <description>First off, I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Halloween to begin with, and I was kind of on the ropes if I should do a Halloween theme for this month or not. Well as you can tell, my girlfriend talked me into using this theme. Honestly, I do quite enjoy how it does quotes. When the month is over I think I know what theme I&amp;rsquo;ll be using for the foreseeable future.</description>
