        <p>Well now that the system is live, I think there&rsquo;s going to be a few things I&rsquo;m going to <em>need</em> to fix. Most all of them are from using mod_chroot. Most aren&rsquo;t anything critical, but things that should be addressed (sooner rather than later.) For instance, I think DNS lookups are failing from inside WordPress. I breifly read in the mod_chroot caveates that this may happen, and I think this is happening now. Another mod_chroot straight from the caveates is PHP mail().</p>
<p>The last issue that isn&rsquo;t completely needed, but one I should probably look into is caching. It&rsquo;s no secret my server is a bit on the low end, and the PHP generated pages can feel a bit sluggish at times (partially because mysql is using what looks like 80% of my RAM.) Long term I plan on spending the $40 and maxing the RAM out to 512 MB, it&rsquo;s just not in my current budget. Probably sometime in the next few months I&rsquo;ll try gretting the two DIMMs.</p>
