  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>I got an MSP430 Launchpad in the mail a couple of days ago. So I&rsquo;ve been playing with that the last couple of days. The first day I went through the tools on the wiki and grabbed both IDE&rsquo;s and all the downloadable links I could. This had to be done on Windows since it&rsquo;s the only platform they support. Being a Linux user 99% of the time, I wasn&rsquo;t too pleased with this situation, so I investigated the tools available for Linux, and that&rsquo;s what I did all of yesterday.</p>
<p>First, I searched the Arch Linux repos (including AUR) for MSP430 related tools. I used yaourt and searched for both msp &amp; msp430. I compiled and installed the compiler, the C library, and two debuggers (more on this later.) After these were installed I grabbed the source to the temperature demo that comes preloaded on the chip. First thing I had to do was change the source in order for it to build with msp430-gcc. The changes were trivial and it didn&rsquo;t take too long to get it compiled. What took me the longest time was trying to figure out if I needed to define what mcu I&rsquo;m using. After a bit of research I fired up the debugger, erased the flash, reflashed, and did some light debugging.</p>
<p>Now, for how it&rsquo;s done. The packages you&rsquo;ll need are as follows: Updated 2012-06-13</p>
<pre><code>binutils-msp430 2.21.1-2
gcc-msp430 4.6.3-1
msp430-gdb 7.2-3
msp430-libc 20120224-2
msp430mcu 20120406-2
mspdebug 0.8-1
</code></pre><p>If you&rsquo;re using a distro other than Arch, it&rsquo;s up to you to figure out how to get and/or build the programs from the source. If you&rsquo;re using Arch, you can obviously use the AUR packages with ABS. If you&rsquo;re an i686 user you can grab my prebuild binaries if you&rsquo;d like from here<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Now that you have a toolchain, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll want to test it out. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Grab my &ldquo;ported&rdquo; temperature demo<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>UPDATE</strong> The here&rsquo;s the fully working temperature demo.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> You&rsquo;ll need to extract it, fire up a terminal, go to that directory, and you should be able to just type: make. If all goes as planned, you&rsquo;ll have main.elf in that directory. So now it&rsquo;s time to try it out, fire up mspdebug. The actual command is probably going to be something like: sudo mspdebug -R. Permissions on the USB device might be able to be changed so it doesn&rsquo;t have to be run as root, but for me and for now, it&rsquo;s not too big of a deal. You should get something like this:</p>

(mspdebug)
</code></pre><p>You&rsquo;re now ready to do some damage!. First, let&rsquo;s just erase the flash. Just type: erase.</p>
<pre><code>(mspdebug) erase
Erasing...
(mspdebug)
</code></pre><p>If you&rsquo;d like to check that the flash is indeed erased, try this:</p>
<pre><code>(mspdebug) dis 0xf800 2048
    f800: ff ff ff ff         AND.B   @R15+,           0xffff(R15)
    f804: ff ff ff ff         AND.B   @R15+,           0xffff(R15)
    f808: ff ff ff ff         AND.B   @R15+,           0xffff(R15)
...........
    fff4: ff ff ff ff         AND.B   @R15+,           0xffff(R15)
    fff8: ff ff ff ff         AND.B   @R15+,           0xffff(R15)
    fffc: ff ff ff ff         AND.B   @R15+,           0xffff(R15)
(mspdebug)
</code></pre><p>As you can see, the entire 2kb of flash is erased. So, now that it&rsquo;s all gone, and the original demo lights turned off (because the program that was running was toasted) we&rsquo;ll want to load our built program into flash:</p>
<pre><code>(mspdebug) prog main.elf
Erasing...
Writing 128 bytes to fc00...
Writing 128 bytes to fc80...
Writing 128 bytes to fd00...
Writing 128 bytes to fd80...
Writing 128 bytes to fe00...
Writing   8 bytes to fe80...
Writing  32 bytes to ffe0...
(mspdebug)
</code></pre><p>As you can see, erasing the first time was most likely not needed. Now we&rsquo;re ready to fire up GDB:</p>
<pre><code>(mspdebug) gdb
Bound to port 2000. Now waiting for connection...
</code></pre><p>At this point you&rsquo;ll want to fire up another terminal, browse back to the source directory, and do:</p>
<pre><code>msp430-gdb main.elf

(gdb) target remote localhost:2000
Remote debugging using localhost:2000
0x0000fc00 in _reset_vector__ ()
(gdb)
</code></pre><p>Basically, start up msp430-gdb with main.elf, set the target to a remote machine (in this case localhost at port 2000), and msp430-gdb and mspdebug do some magic, and you&rsquo;re ready to start debugging. Since you&rsquo;re debugging a remote target, remember you &ldquo;continue&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There you have it, you should be in pretty good shape to start experimenting with the MSP430 Launchpad on Linux.</p>
<p>Addendum:
Big thanks to Henry von Tresckow (hvontres) who fixed the temperature demo to fully work with mspgcc. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m yet to test it, but his changes look convincing enough.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I&rsquo;ve tested the changes and they seem to work fine. Here&rsquo;s the [updated temperature demo][3] (updated 2012-06-13.)</p>
<p>Update:
Added msp430mcu as a required package. Thanks Frankie Robertson for pointing that out in the comments. 🙂</p>
