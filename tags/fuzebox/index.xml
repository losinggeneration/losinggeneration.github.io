      <description>Yesterday I went ahead and bought a Fuzebox which is an open source 8-bit console that is compatible with the Uzebox. Sadly, it won&amp;rsquo;t be here till next month (most likely.) It&amp;rsquo;s currently back ordered (which I knew while ordering it) but is expected to be back in stock the 29th. So hopefully early next month it&amp;rsquo;ll be here. Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s probably better that it&amp;rsquo;ll be a couple weeks it gets here.</description>

      <description>I’ve been sort of obsessing over Uzebox lately. Even without purchasing the hardware yet, I’m getting a pretty excited about the possibilities of this small little console. Not just from the programming aspect, but also because Fuzebox looks like a great exercise in assembling/soldering. I’ve also been considering how/where I should cut the case that Fuzebox provides in their “Starter Kit.” For instance, the one of the things I imagine I’ll be using often is the FTDI to upload code to test and play with.</description>
