      <title>HGE Go work</title>

      <description>I just realized I never actually posted about why I was doing a C binding of C++. Basically I bound most of Haaf&amp;rsquo;s Game Engine (HGE) from C++ to C. I ended up getting a bit stuck on the GUI elements and getting a nice way to let them do simple inheritance and polymorphism based on the current C++ classes. This actually wasn&amp;rsquo;t a problem for my end-game which was to take that C binding and make a Go version with cgo.</description>

      <title>C Bindings for C&#43;&#43;</title>

      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with writing C bindings for a C++ library. Your first thought might be, &amp;ldquo;Why would you bind a C++ to C?&amp;rdquo; Those of you who have ever had to do bindings to other languages may already know the answer. In general, it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to bind C to another language than it is to bind C++ directly. Another, albeit less likely, reason might be because a client wants a C interface instead.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work at my project which I&amp;rsquo;m yet to call by name on here (and will continue to be that way until I have a playable demo.) First, a status update. I&amp;rsquo;ve ditched the idea of doing the entire engine myself and have now migrated to HGE (Haaf&amp;rsquo;s Game Engine) which fairly recently had a port to *nix and OS X by Ryan C. Gordon. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked a bit on the engine itself after the source release and my changes were pulled in upstream (mostly it adding a CMake build system, but I also did some things like get the tutorial/examples working, silenced warnings, etc.</description>

      <title>CrabEmu for the Didj</title>

      <description>Well, I&amp;rsquo;m releasing what I&amp;rsquo;ll call version 0.1.0 of CrabEmu for the Didj. It includes a custom built rootfs with no questionable code from the LF distribution (for instance, their scripts for checking various things like USB connections.) This initial release requires a DJHI or other third party card that is SD capable. The SD must also have two partitions: Fat32 &amp;amp; Ext 3. Because of the later, you&amp;rsquo;ll also need an OS that&amp;rsquo;s able to read/write to Ext 3 file systems.</description>

      <title>Sega Master System Coding</title>

      <description>Besides updating my server, I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite busy with some Sega Master System (SMS from here-on-out) coding. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to switch to SMS for now instead of Game Gear for now. It seems I&amp;rsquo;ve kind of went my own way with this project. From the looks of it, most people either use WLA-DX or, to a much lesser extent, z88dk. I don&amp;rsquo;t see too much about any other assemblers/compilers. Granted, I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked terribly hard for the topics though.</description>

      <description>I’ve been sort of obsessing over Uzebox lately. Even without purchasing the hardware yet, I’m getting a pretty excited about the possibilities of this small little console. Not just from the programming aspect, but also because Fuzebox looks like a great exercise in assembling/soldering. I’ve also been considering how/where I should cut the case that Fuzebox provides in their “Starter Kit.” For instance, the one of the things I imagine I’ll be using often is the FTDI to upload code to test and play with.</description>
