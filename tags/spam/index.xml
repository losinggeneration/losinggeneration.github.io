      <description>I just thought I&amp;rsquo;d make a quick post about two WordPress plugins which seem to work great for spam detection. The first one is Akismet. Alone it seems to catch most spam here. The problem with this plugin alone is, there may still be false positives. This requires more time on my part to skim over my spam to see if there was any legit comments.
This brings me to the second plugin, Conditional CAPTCHA.</description>

      <description>Well, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to cut down on the spam (only a few spam bots so far have attempted to post, but I know there will be more.) I&amp;rsquo;m trying out SI Captcha to see if that helps. I just wish it had an option to still email upon failed comment posts (or something similar till I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s working.) Oh well, I&amp;rsquo;ll still be moderating comments, but I hope this will help cut down on the amount of spam comments I have to moderate.</description>

      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;ve only been up for about three weeks and I&amp;rsquo;ve already got my first spam comment (which is why I moderate all comments ATM.) Also, it was kind of strange, I went to go here at work today and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to connect. So, I logged into my router. I thought that my iptables were screwy again, so I started trying to fix them by hand. Deleted a rule and BAM no more connectivity to my router (at all.</description>
