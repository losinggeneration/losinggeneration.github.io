        <p>In a personal project which I&rsquo;ve been working on and off on for the last three or so years (without really getting much done to be totally honest), I&rsquo;ve decided to use Lua for the configuration file. The project itself is in C++, so this lead me to use the Lua C API to embed it in the project. Prior to deciding on Lua, I was using a manually parsed key/value format. The only thing to really change between the new format an the old is an &lsquo;=&rsquo; between the key &amp; value (since it&rsquo;s just a Lua file after all.) The advantage is that I don&rsquo;t have to worry about trying to manually parse it, because I wasn&rsquo;t really checking for errors in the file and assuming everything was fine while reading the input (mainly because I was too lazy to actually implement error checking.) That alone (and having an extensible format) is reason enough to use it.</p>
<p>Now, things weren&rsquo;t all quick and easy. I learned a pretty hard lesson along the way. Anyone can tell you that it&rsquo;s good practice to keep the stack balanced. In my case it was totally required. At some point I either overlooked or got careless to the fact that lua_to* does not remove the element off the stack. So as I was trying to push and pull variables from Lua I was encountering crashes. I&rsquo;m ashamed to say it took me more hours than I&rsquo;d like to say before I thought to check my logic to see if the stack was getting out of balance. It seems like one of those, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ever want to have to spend that long tracking down something so silly again,&rdquo; mistakes. I think I will always make sure the stack is well balanced when working with Lua from now on (unless there&rsquo;s a good reason to leave things there.) So I suppose it was worth it to learn to be more careful in the future.</p>
