      <description>I decided it was time to have some form of backups in place. Currently all I&amp;rsquo;m really (automatically) backing up is the WordPress MySQL table since it&amp;rsquo;s the thing to changes on a regular basis. Everything else on this server can be backed up by hand when/if I make changes. It would be faster if/when something does fail (hard drive most likely) to have a recent full backup image to restore from, but really, a good backup of the MySQL table(s), a backup of important configuration files (since they rarely change, I back them up manually after change(s)), and a backup up various directories that&amp;rsquo;d be nice to restore quickly (most of which change infrequently.</description>
