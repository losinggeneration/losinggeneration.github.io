        <p>I&rsquo;m going to be without internet at home for awhile it looks like. The server this blog was run from was just a computer I had in my apartment. Since that&rsquo;s going to be down sometime in the near future I decided it was time to figure out something to do in the meantime. The solution was to move this blog to a server I know will stay up while I&rsquo;m moving. I asked at work, and we have a server here that I was told I was allowed to use, so that&rsquo;s what I did today. I moved my server configuration, files, and database to the new server. It seems to all be running smoothly. Let me know if you notice any weirdness in the meantime.</p>
<p>—Addendum—
It will take a bit to get everything push back from wp-upload. So things there may not work till it&rsquo;s all done uploading the couple gigs of data…</p>
<p>—Addendum 2—
Just thought I&rsquo;d mention that everything is back up now in the wp-upload folder.</p>
