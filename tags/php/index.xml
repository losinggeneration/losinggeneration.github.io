      <title>Pleased with Server’s Performance</title>

      <description>I have to say, my server is performing beyond my initial expectations! I think I have everything tweaked to not use massive amounts of RAM (*cough*MySQL*cough*.) Here&amp;rsquo;s how the free -m currently looks: $ free -m&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; total used free shared buffers cached&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; Mem: 121 90 31 0 2 46&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; -/+ buffers/cache: 41 80&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; Swap: 1121 14 1107 As you can see, it&amp;rsquo;s doing pretty good. I&amp;rsquo;ve even upped the maximum simultaneous Apache connections since it seems to be able to handle that a better now (rather then bringing the server to its knees when something like 10-15 people tried to access it at once.</description>

      <title>Taken care of</title>

      <description>Well, I think I have all the previous issues taken care of. Caching may or may not work, but it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be happening now. So mail and DNS lookups work now (DNS only being useful from my side.) So, all-in-all I hope this beast can just run for several months and I&amp;rsquo;ll see what (if anything) needs to be done in that time. So now that my server should be stable, I&amp;rsquo;m free to work on other endevors!</description>

      <title>Few more things that I should fix yet</title>

      <description>Well now that the system is live, I think there&amp;rsquo;s going to be a few things I&amp;rsquo;m going to need to fix. Most all of them are from using mod_chroot. Most aren&amp;rsquo;t anything critical, but things that should be addressed (sooner rather than later.) For instance, I think DNS lookups are failing from inside WordPress. I breifly read in the mod_chroot caveates that this may happen, and I think this is happening now.</description>

      <title>Zoneinfo</title>

      <description>Ok, it looks like I just needed to add /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Chicago to my chroot, and I think that solved that issue. Simple enough really.</description>

      <title>Chrooted Apache</title>
      <link>https://losinggeneration.com/2009/09/13/chrooted-apache/</link>

      <description>﻿
As I prepare to have my server public, I&amp;rsquo;ve chrooted my server&amp;rsquo;s Apache with mod_chroot. This allows me to have the advantages of a chroot environment without as many of the draw backs. There is still some strangeness to work out. For instance &amp;ldquo;Warning: timezone_open() [function.timezone-open]: Unknown or bad timezone (America/Chicago) in /wp/wp-includes/functions.phpon line 3160&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;ll get this figured out, but honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s not a huge deal. I may have to have Apache load the zoneinfo file, or perhaps not… Really, the only change I had to make to WordPress was to have it connect to the MySQL database on 127.</description>
