        <p>Because of my renewed interest in Z80 and wanting to better learn assembly programming, I ultimately want to do a bit with Game Gear/SMS coding. For this though, an emulator with at least some basic debugging facilities would be useful. After searching Linux Game Gear emulators, none really had what I was looking for.</p>
<p>On my first attempt, I decided Dega looked interesting, it has source available. The two major turn offs of Dega was the Z80 core which is x86 assembly, which is obviously not portable and it&rsquo;s license which basically says, do what you want to the source, as long as it&rsquo;s not sold. Now, I don&rsquo;t ever plan on selling my changes, but the license is still a bit undesirable. Regardless, I did a bit of work seeing how hard it would be to rip out the Z80 core and drop in a new one. I had a pretty descent start, and things were starting to look promising, but the above two issues kept lingering so I decided to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Enter, CrabEmu. Now, this emulator got immediate bonus points for being developed by Lawrence Sebald (often known as BlueCrab.) I&rsquo;ve know him from KOS for quite some time. CrabEmu is mainly developed for Mac OS X, but also has a Dreamcast and Qt port. The entire emulator core is written in C (so it&rsquo;s portable), and the Qt port had a lot of the work already done for me. It&rsquo;s also released under the GPL v2 which is nice. So, it seemed like a good fit for what I wanted.</p>
<p>So, I grabbed the latest source I could find (0.1.9) Created a git repo out of it to track my work and started working on adding in a debugger. By about the time I had the Z80 CPU register debugger implemented and working I finally caught BlueCrab on IRC and told him what I was working on. He decided that it was past due for him to have CrabEmu&rsquo;s svn on sourceforge (where the project is hosted.) He also gave me commit access so I could help maintain the Qt port. So, here we are now. I&rsquo;ve got the CPU and VDP debugger on par with the OS X version of CrabEmu. I&rsquo;m looking into a few other issues the Qt port has, and thinking of other features to add.</p>
