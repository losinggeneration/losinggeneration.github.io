      <description>Besides updating my server, I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite busy with some Sega Master System (SMS from here-on-out) coding. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to switch to SMS for now instead of Game Gear for now. It seems I&amp;rsquo;ve kind of went my own way with this project. From the looks of it, most people either use WLA-DX or, to a much lesser extent, z88dk. I don&amp;rsquo;t see too much about any other assemblers/compilers. Granted, I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked terribly hard for the topics though.</description>

      <description>I’ve been sort of obsessing over Uzebox lately. Even without purchasing the hardware yet, I’m getting a pretty excited about the possibilities of this small little console. Not just from the programming aspect, but also because Fuzebox looks like a great exercise in assembling/soldering. I’ve also been considering how/where I should cut the case that Fuzebox provides in their “Starter Kit.” For instance, the one of the things I imagine I’ll be using often is the FTDI to upload code to test and play with.</description>
