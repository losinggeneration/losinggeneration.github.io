      <description>So, while I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get kdelibs 4.3.2 built on Arch Linux PPC. I decided since Arch PPC hasn&amp;rsquo;t had any packages updated in about six months that I should probably do something crazy like grab the official Arch&amp;rsquo;s ABS to build all the packages from. Now, 130 built packages later I&amp;rsquo;m close. Perhaps I should put into perspective what was needed to be updated. The packages ranged from GCC, Binutils, &amp;amp; Glibc, to xulrunner, to hal, to mysql, to pygtk, to gnome-vfs.</description>

      <description>Update Sept 04, 2011 As this still gets comments occasionally, I should clearly note that this is (and has been for some time) an accepted issue on Arch&amp;rsquo;s bug tracker. There is a basic accepted game plan for how it will be implemented, but is currently marked as low-priority. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the details look at: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/16702#comment80122. Also, please do not comment on that bug report because it&amp;rsquo;s very close to being closed just to keep people from further commenting &amp;ldquo;new &amp;lsquo;solutions&amp;rsquo; that we simply won&amp;rsquo;t implement.</description>
