      <description>So, the comments got a bit long in the last post. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll clean it up, and get the interesting tidbits out of there and present them here in a clear fashion. Also, while I appreciate ﻿Michael B. Trausch&amp;rsquo;s discussion on the topic, and provided some interesting discussion points (which will be discussed further here.) Also, reading through my arguments that I put in the comments of the last post really didn&amp;rsquo;t flow together.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of rewriting this with some information and rebuttals to some of the comments. Stay tuned for that later tonight. Sorry to anyone on identi.ca in !ubuntu !linux or !gnu that may be writting a comment now. I&amp;rsquo;m locking comments so the newer one will get the traffic (since it&amp;rsquo;s going to be much better written than this one which I spent all of 10 minutes on.) &amp;lt;/end edit&amp;gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why there&amp;rsquo;s so much push to have the Linux OS, called GNU/Linux.</description>
