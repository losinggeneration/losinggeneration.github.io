      <description>This post is a bit different than what I normally write about. This post is about my guitar that I&amp;rsquo;ve had now for about eight years. It was a birthday present and was basically refurbished by one of the guitar shops in my home town. The guitar, a Peavey Raptor Exp Plus, originally looked like this:
This was fine and all, but after eight years and quite frankly wanting to upgrade the internals, I decided I&amp;rsquo;d take the time to first paint the guitar and also modify the pickguard.</description>

      <description>I agree it&amp;rsquo;s a cool and novel idea for a WordPress plugin and I do think you&amp;rsquo;ll have to continue moderating comments because like a few of us have said, it&amp;rsquo;s not a terribly effective CAPTCHA. Not to mention when you say &amp;ldquo;please make a bot that does this, we’d love to see it,&amp;rdquo; you can bet at least one or two people will do just that (if for no other reason because you said you&amp;rsquo;d love to see it, you know, to please you)</description>
