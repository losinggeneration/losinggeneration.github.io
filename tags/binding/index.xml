      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before (actually, probably only in that last post) about a game I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on on and off for the last few years (I think I said three, but it&amp;rsquo;s actually been five, with it being inactive for most of that time.) I had decided long ago that it would probably be scripted with Lua and I&amp;rsquo;m just now finally getting around to experimenting with that. I&amp;rsquo;ve ultimately decided it&amp;rsquo;s going to either be using OOLua or Luabind.</description>
