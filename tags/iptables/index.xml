      <description>Well, technically we&amp;rsquo;ve been live for about 4 hours, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize at the time that using DNAT with iptables actually caused the NATed server to become unavailable from the LAN. I was actually trying to get everything setup in FwBuilder, but I may have hit a limitation since I could not find a way to do &amp;ldquo;-A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/16 -j SNAT —to-source 206.127.184.118&amp;rdquo; I must say this was an interesting learning experience.</description>
