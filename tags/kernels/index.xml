      <description>Update Sept 04, 2011 As this still gets comments occasionally, I should clearly note that this is (and has been for some time) an accepted issue on Arch&amp;rsquo;s bug tracker. There is a basic accepted game plan for how it will be implemented, but is currently marked as low-priority. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the details look at: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/16702#comment80122. Also, please do not comment on that bug report because it&amp;rsquo;s very close to being closed just to keep people from further commenting &amp;ldquo;new &amp;lsquo;solutions&amp;rsquo; that we simply won&amp;rsquo;t implement.</description>
