      On the 28th of last month (2013/06/28) I lost my subdomain name that I had previously been getting for Dyn for free. For a long time Dyn offered free dynamic DNS. I setup my subdomain with them on their homelinux.org. This was initially needed because the server was being run from my, well, home. This provided a convenient method to automatically update the DNS records when my IP would change. This worked well, and it worked well for a long time.

      After my server was down for a couple days (because I was physically moving the machine to another location) I decided to check if there were any updates. Sure enough, there just happened to be an update for 3.2 and it had the usual warning of “be sure to backup your database and files” which I either ignore or partially ignore. I do typically do a mysqldump before running any of the updates, but I almost never backup the WordPress directory itself.

      I’ve now updated my home server to Debian 6.0. In the process I’ve decided to also switch to lighttpd from Apache HTTP. I do miss the fact that mod_chroot in Apache was able to basically take care of the dependencies for me and build the chroot daemon startup, but it wasn’t too much work to get everything up and going in a chroot. It ended up one of my plugins (Last.

      I’m going to be without internet at home for awhile it looks like. The server this blog was run from was just a computer I had in my apartment. Since that’s going to be down sometime in the near future I decided it was time to figure out something to do in the meantime. The solution was to move this blog to a server I know will stay up while I’m moving.

      I decided it was time to have some form of backups in place. Currently all I’m really (automatically) backing up is the WordPress MySQL table since it’s the thing to changes on a regular basis. Everything else on this server can be backed up by hand when/if I make changes. It would be faster if/when something does fail (hard drive most likely) to have a recent full backup image to restore from, but really, a good backup of the MySQL table(s), a backup of important configuration files (since they rarely change, I back them up manually after change(s)), and a backup up various directories that’d be nice to restore quickly (most of which change infrequently.

      I have to say, my server is performing beyond my initial expectations! I think I have everything tweaked to not use massive amounts of RAM (<em>cough</em>MySQL<em>cough</em>.) Here’s how the free -m currently looks: $ free -m&lt;br /&gt; total used free shared buffers cached&lt;br /&gt; Mem: 121 90 31 0 2 46&lt;br /&gt; -/+ buffers/cache: 41 80&lt;br /&gt; Swap: 1121 14 1107 As you can see, it’s doing pretty good. I’ve even upped the maximum simultaneous Apache connections since it seems to be able to handle that a better now (rather then bringing the server to its knees when something like 10-15 people tried to access it at once.

      Well, I’m going to try to cut down on the spam (only a few spam bots so far have attempted to post, but I know there will be more.) I’m trying out SI Captcha to see if that helps. I just wish it had an option to still email upon failed comment posts (or something similar till I’m sure it’s working.) Oh well, I’ll still be moderating comments, but I hope this will help cut down on the amount of spam comments I have to moderate.

      So, I recently set a link to my discussion of Linux, GNU, and OS’s to someone on Identi.ca. I made a point not to add groups to !linux and !gnu because I knew my server would probably get hit hard (if you’ve looked at my server’s specs, you’ll know it doesn’t take much to be considered hit hard.) Well, they read it, after which they posted a link to my blog with the groups !

      So, I’ve only been up for about three weeks and I’ve already got my first spam comment (which is why I moderate all comments ATM.) Also, it was kind of strange, I went to go here at work today and I wasn’t able to connect. So, I logged into my router. I thought that my iptables were screwy again, so I started trying to fix them by hand. Deleted a rule and BAM no more connectivity to my router (at all.

      Well, I think I have all the previous issues taken care of. Caching may or may not work, but it’s supposed to be happening now. So mail and DNS lookups work now (DNS only being useful from my side.) So, all-in-all I hope this beast can just run for several months and I’ll see what (if anything) needs to be done in that time. So now that my server should be stable, I’m free to work on other endevors!
