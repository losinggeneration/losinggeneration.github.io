      <description>I got an MSP430 Launchpad in the mail a couple of days ago. So I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with that the last couple of days. The first day I went through the tools on the wiki and grabbed both IDE&amp;rsquo;s and all the downloadable links I could. This had to be done on Windows since it&amp;rsquo;s the only platform they support. Being a Linux user 99% of the time, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too pleased with this situation, so I investigated the tools available for Linux, and that&amp;rsquo;s what I did all of yesterday.</description>
